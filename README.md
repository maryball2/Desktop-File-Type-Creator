# Desktop-File-Type-Creator
Have you ever downloaded a program from github and installed it only to have it not show up in search on your linux machine? Well that won't happen anymore with Desktop File Type Creator! Using Java I was able to create a program that automatically creates a .desktop file type for every application you need!

Download the .jar for the progam and the .java for the source

Current work that needs to be done:
  Have the program automatically move the .desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications
